Base Instructions
=================

Copying Data
------------
The ``data`` directory contains the functions ``copy_c_0`` and ``copy_c_1`` in the file ``copy_c.c``.
The function ``copy_c_0`` simply copies seven ``int32_t`` values from one array to another.
The ``copy_c_1`` function has an additional input parameter ``n`` specifying the number of values to be copied.

Additionally, a driver is provided in the file ``copy_driver.cpp``.
The driver calls ``copy_c_0`` and ``copy_c_1`` on sample data and checks the results.
The driver also calls the unfinished functions ``copy_asm_0`` and ``copy_asm_1``, which are located in the file ``copy_asm.s``.

.. admonition:: Tasks

  1. Implement the function ``copy_asm_0`` using only base instructions. The function should have the same functionality as its C counterpart.
  2. Implement the function ``copy_asm_1`` using only base instructions. The function should have the same functionality as its C counterpart.

Execution Throughput and Latency
--------------------------------

.. admonition:: Tasks

  1. Microbenchmark the execution throughput of `ADD (shifted register) <https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-03/Base-Instructions/ADD--shifted-register---Add-optionally-shifted-register->`__ and `MUL <https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-03/Base-Instructions/MUL--Multiply--an-alias-of-MADD->`__.
  2. Microbenchmark the execution latency of ADD (shifted register) and MUL.
