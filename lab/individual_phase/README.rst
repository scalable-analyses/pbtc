Our lab concludes with an individual phase allowing you to pursue your own ideas.
Examples could include further parallelization and optimization of your compiler at all levels, or new features like support for bias terms, residual connections, or reduction operations.

.. admonition:: Task

    1. Write a brief sketch (at least half a page) of your idea for the individual phase. Consider risks and outcomes!
    2. Prepare a five-minute pitch of your idea.
